The Kokkos project members was supported by the [Exascale Computing Project
(ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org), a collaborative effort of two DOE
organizations—the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security
Administration—responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable
exascale ecosystem—including software, applications, hardware, advanced system
engineering, and early testbed platforms—to support the nation’s exascale
computing imperative.

Kokkos was initiated at SNL and funded through [Sandia's Laboratory Directed
Research & Development (LDRD)](https://www.sandia.gov/research/ldrd/) program.
