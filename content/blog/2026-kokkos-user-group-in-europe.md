# Join the Kokkos User Group in Europe at the HPSF Community Summit 2026!

We are pleased to announce the next [Kokkos User Group meeting in Europe](https://events.academiccloud.de/e/hpsfcs26) that will take place in **Braunschweig, Germany** on **February 25th to 27th**.
The user group meeting will happen as part of the [**High Performance Software Foundation Community Summit**](https://events.academiccloud.de/e/hpsfcs26).

Following in the tradition of the European Trilinos & Kokkos User Group (EuroTUG) meeting series, this community summit offers a platform for Europe-based users, developers and members of the High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) and its projects to
* learn about recent developments
* report on their use cases and experiences
* interact with core developers
* form a European network of HPSF project users and developers.

The summit will be the occasion to learn what’s new with HPSF projects, give us feedback on your use of HPSF software, meet with project communities, and tell us how to grow and improve them.
[Submit an abstract for a presentation, or a poster](https://events.academiccloud.de/event/143/abstracts/) and present your unique point of view and insight to explore together how open collaboration and a foundation for high performance software can unlock new possibilities for high performance computing.

Build the Future of High Performance Software with the High Performance Software Foundation. Join the the leading minds that drive the advancement of community-driven software solutions for performance, portability, and productivity in HPC: engineers, researchers, developers, and users, from academia, industry, and government laboratories alike. The first HPSF Community Summit in Europe covers all aspects of building software for HPC, from the users and contributors point of view, spanning small systems to the largest supercomputers, in link with AI, and accelerated computing, with a special focus on HPSF software. Join us to connect, learn, and lead the charge in transforming how we build and use software.
