# Kokkos-FFT key features

We are pleased to announce that [Kokkos-FFT](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft) v1.0.0 has just been released. Let us recap its key features [1]:

* A simple interface like [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) with in-place and out-of-place transforms:  
Only accepts [Kokkos Views](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/view/view.html) to make APIs simple and safe.

* 1D, 2D, 3D standard and real FFT functions (similar to [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html)) over 1D to 8D Kokkos Views:  
Batched plans are automatically used if `View` dimension is larger than FFT dimension.

* A reusable [FFT plan](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/plan/plan.html) which wraps the vendor libraries for various Kokkos backends: 
[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org), [cuFFT](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft), [hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/hipFFT) ([rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT)), and [oneMKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) are automatically enabled based on the enabled Kokkos backends.

* Support for multiple CPU and GPU backends:
FFT libraries for the enabled Kokkos backends are executed on the stream/queue used in their corresponding execution spaces.

* Compile-time and run-time checks for invalid usage (e.g. `View` extents mismatch).

# Major changes in release v1.0.0

By releasing `Kokkos-FFT` v1.0.0, we consider `KokkosFFT` production ready and the experimental warning has been suppressed. Here are the major changes:

* To align with `Kokkos` 5.0, we have set C++20 as a minimal requirement.
* We have completed the refactoring of source codes as well as CIs and documentations.
* We have secured the current APIs, we will not break current APIs under `KokkosFFT` namespace, until the next major release.
* We have created a `Spack` recipe to ease installation.
* We have created a [`Slack channel`](https://kokkosteam.slack.com/archives/C07NM5SD3FD) for support.

# Future developments

We are planning to add the following functionalities. Contributions to the project are highly welcomed (see [developer guide](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html)).

* Multi-GPU support with MPI. We have started the integration of a prototype [2] into the [Kokkos-FFT](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft) repository (see z-velocity plot from a distributed Taylor–Green vortex simulation).

* Device callable batched capability of FFTs like [`Kokkos Kernels`](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels)

* Supporting callbacks if backend library supports that
