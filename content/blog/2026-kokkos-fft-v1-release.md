# Kokkos-FFT key features

We are pleased to announce that [Kokkos-FFT](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft) v1.0.0 has just been released, and has reached the production level. Let us recap its key features [1]:

* Integrated naturally in the Kokkos ecosystem on top of [Kokkos Views](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/view/view.html) and [Kokkos ExecutionSpace](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/execution_spaces.html).

* A simple interface like [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html) with in-place and out-of-place transforms:  
Only accepts `Kokkos Views` to make APIs simple and safe.

* 1D, 2D, 3D standard and real FFT functions (similar to [`numpy.fft`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html)) over 1D to 8D Kokkos Views:  
Batched plans are automatically used if `View` dimension is larger than FFT dimension.

* A reusable [FFT plan](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/plan/plan.html) which wraps the vendor libraries for various Kokkos backends: 
[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) for Host Backends (`Serial`, `OpenMP`, and `Threads`), [cuFFT](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft) for `Cuda` backend, [hipFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/hipFFT) ([rocFFT](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT)) for `HIP` backend, and [oneMKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html) for `SYCL` backend are automatically enabled based on the enabled Kokkos backends.

* Compile-time and run-time checks for invalid usage (e.g. `View` extents mismatch).

# Major changes in release v1.0.0

By releasing `Kokkos-FFT` v1.0.0, we consider `KokkosFFT` production-ready and the experimental warning has been suppressed. Here are the major changes:

* To align with `Kokkos` 5.0, we have set C++20 as a minimal requirement (minimum requirement of `Kokkos` is still 4.6, but recommended to use `Kokkos` 5.0 or later).

* We have improved the [documentations](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

* You can expect the APIs to remain stable; we follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and will not break current APIs under `KokkosFFT` namespace, until the next major release.

* We have created a [`Spack` recipe](https://packages.spack.io/package.html?name=kokkos-fft) to ease installation.

* You can join us in the [\#kokkos-fft](https://kokkosteam.slack.com/archives/C07NM5SD3FD) channel for support on the Kokkos Slack Workspace.

# Future developments

We are planning to add the following functionalities. Contributions to the project are highly welcomed (see [developer guide](https://kokkosfft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html)).

* Multi-GPU support with MPI. We have started the integration of a prototype [2] into the [Kokkos-FFT](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-fft) repository (see the thumbnail for the x component of vorticity plot from a distributed Taylor–Green vortex simulation).

* Device callable batched capability of FFTs like [`Kokkos Kernels`](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels)

* Supporting callbacks if backend library supports that
