We're thrilled to announce that the Kokkos Core project has achieved the
"passing" badge from the OpenSSF Best Practices Program! This milestone
reflects our ongoing commitment to maintaining high standards for security,
quality, and overall project health.

This achievement comes a year after Kokkos joined the High Performance Software
Foundation (HPSF), and our efforts to improve the project have been aligned
with the foundation's goals of fostering sustainable and high-quality
high-performance computing software.

The [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en) is a
rigorous assessment that evaluates projects across a wide range of criteria,
including:

* **Security:** Implementing secure development practices and vulnerability
  management.
* **Code Quality:** Adhering to coding standards and conducting thorough
  testing.
* **Project Governance:** Establishing clear governance policies and fostering
  a healthy community.
* **Documentation:** Providing comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.

Achieving the "passing" badge demonstrates that Kokkos meets these essential
benchmarks, providing users with a reliable and trustworthy foundation for
performance portability in their applications.

### What This Means for Kokkos Users:

This achievement reinforces our dedication to delivering a robust and secure
library. By meeting the OpenSSF Best Practices criteria, we're ensuring that
Kokkos Core is built on a solid foundation, minimizing risks and enhancing the
long-term sustainability of the project.

### Our Commitment to Continuous Improvement:

We view this badge as a stepping stone in our ongoing journey to improve
Kokkos. We will continue to leverage best practices and actively engage with
the OpenSSF community to further enhance the security and quality of our
project.

We extend our sincere gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the Kokkos
project and helped us reach this milestone. We encourage you to explore Kokkos
Core and experience the benefits of a well-maintained and secure performance
portability library.
