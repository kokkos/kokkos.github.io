The Kokkos User Group (KUG) Meeting 2025 took place in Chicago, IL, from May 7th to 8th, 2025, as part of the inaugural High Performance Software Foundation (HPSFcon) conference. The meeting brought together researchers, developers, and HPC professionals interested in the Kokkos ecosystem.

# Day 1: 
The first day of the KUG Meeting kicked off with essential updates from the core Kokkos development team. These updates covered the roadmap for the Kokkos ecosystem, including progress towards the anticipated Kokkos 5 release slated for Summer 2025, which will require a C++20 compiler. Following the updates, the focus shifted to practical applications of Kokkos in the "Kokkos in Applications" session. Here, users from various domains presented their work, highlighting how they are leveraging Kokkos to achieve performance portability and tackle complex computational challenges. The afternoon continued with a session dedicated to "Adopting Kokkos," which featured talks and discussions centered around strategies, best practices, and lessons learned when integrating Kokkos into existing or new projects. The day concluded with a dynamic lightning talks session, offering a series of short, engaging presentations on a diverse range of Kokkos-related topics. This format allowed for a broad overview of ongoing work and emerging ideas within the Kokkos community.

# Day 2
The second day broadened the scope to the wider "Kokkos Ecosystem." This session included presentations on libraries and tools that complement and extend the core Kokkos functionality, fostering collaboration and interoperability within the HPC software stack. The meeting then delved into the critical aspects of "Tuning and Performance," where attendees shared techniques, methodologies, and insights for optimizing Kokkos-based applications to achieve peak performance on diverse hardware architectures. This was followed by a session on "Algorithms," potentially showcasing how specific algorithms are being implemented and optimized using Kokkos' parallel programming models. The KUG Meeting culminated in an engaging panel discussion. This session brought together core Kokkos developers, library leads, ecosystem project members, application experts, numerical toolkit developers, and educators. The panel addressed key challenges, future directions, and answered questions from the audience, providing valuable insights and fostering a deeper understanding of the Kokkos landscape.
