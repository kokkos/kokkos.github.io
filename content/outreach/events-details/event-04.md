Who should attend?  
Anyone who has a C++ application, or would like to create C++ Kokkos capability that hooks onto an application, and would like to have a single source code run well on multiple platforms. We also encourage developers to bring applications that already use Kokkos since Kokkos experts will be available to help with more advanced use cases. Although we strongly suggest teams of two (or more) per application, please do not hesitate to apply if you are a single developer who wants attend this event.

What happens at the event?
We will have Kokkos experts to help you with your application. This event is a tutorial and a playground to experiment with integrating Kokkos with your application and to help optimize existing Kokkos applications.

What happens after the event?   
Attendance to this event will help us create a relationship with your team that we hope to continue as you return home to continue your work. The Kokkos is always available on its Slack channel: [kokkosteam.slack.com](kokkosteam.slack.com)

How should I prepare?
If you are new to Kokkos, we can help you prepare a kernel for the event. If you have an existing Kokkos application, we would like to understand your needs before the event. We hope that doing this prep work will maximize your time learning from Kokkos experts.
