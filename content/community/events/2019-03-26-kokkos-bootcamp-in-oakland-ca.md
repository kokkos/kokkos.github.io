We are pleased to announce that we are hosting the next **Performance Portability with Kokkos Bootcamp** March 26-29, 2019 at the Oakland City Center Conference Center in Oakland, CA. This workshop is intended to teach new Kokkos users how to get started and to help existing Kokkos users to further improve their codes. The training will cover the minimum required topics to get your application started on using Kokkos, and Kokkos experts will be on hand to help the more advanced users.

Who should attend?  
Anyone who has a C++ application, or would like to create C++ Kokkos kernels that hook onto an application, and would like to have a single source code run well on multiple platforms. We also encourage developers to bring applications that already use Kokkos since Kokkos experts will be available to help with more advanced use cases. Although we strongly suggest teams of two (or more) per application, please do not hesitate to apply if you are a single developer who wants attend this event.

What happens at the event?   
We will have Kokkos experts to help you with your application. This event is a tutorial and a playground to experiment with integrating Kokkos with your application and to help optimize existing Kokkos applications.

What happens after the event?   
Attendance to this event will help us create a relationship with your team that we hope to continue as you return home to continue your work. We plan to host regular office hours to tend to your teams questions in the initial stages and to help your team continue to make significant progress.

How should I prepare?   
After signing up, we will contact you to discuss your application. If you are new to Kokkos, we can help you prepare a kernel for the event. If you have an existing Kokkos application, we would like to understand your needs before the event. We hope that doing this prep work will maximize your time learning from Kokkos experts.

How do I apply?    
Registration for this event is now closed.
